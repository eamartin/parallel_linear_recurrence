* To do for paper
** Edit all
** Look up templates etc, double-check there's not one out there
** Do and write up the experiments
*** Synthetic Task
**** Already done, written up. Need to review
*** Medical Task
**** Being done, need to check on testing set
**** Need to write up
*** Throughput Task
**** Chat to Eric about this
**** Just generate random data
*** PLR/SLR comparison
**** Have the pure kernel data

**** Do that for random data
**** Do a 2-layer network, with varying seq_len
**** Report the throughput

| Sequence Length | LS-LSTM |  SRU | QRNN(2) | QRNN(10 |
|-----------------+---------+------+---------+---------|
| 16              |    0.61 | 0.28 |    0.38 |    0.78 |
| 256             |    0.91 | 0.84 |    0.86 |    0.99 |
| 4,096           |    0.98 | 1.38 |    1.18 |    1.05 |
| 65,536          |    1.41 | 9.21 |    6.68 |    2.05 |
For an input_size of 24, output 2, hidden_size 256, 
batch_size 65536 / seq_len

** Collate the experiments and smooth
** Think about the overall message of the piece and rewrite as necessary
** Send to Adam, Andy to check
** Submit
*** Then go to party and relax the fuck out


* Timeline
** Saturday evening:
*** Done interesting medical results, tested on testing set
*** Looked at throughput task
*** Done PLR / SLR throughput task
** Sunday evening:
*** Fully written up medical task
*** Written up throuput and PLR/SLR task
*** Start editing the paper, smoothing into a cohesive whole
** Monday evening:
*** Finish editing, send off to everyone else


* Paper structure
** Introduction, abstract, background
*** Describe 
We can apply the PLR method to any architecture that satisfies the 
constraints. E.g. SRU, QRNN, etc. Introduce LS-LSTM as good substitute.
Describe how previous papers have shown that linear LSTMs work well, this
approach allows us to speed it up.
** Experiments
*** Benchmarks 
**** Throughput of pure PLR kernel vs SLR kernel
**** Show how it speeds up the SRU, QRNN, and LS-LSTM
**** Show how the LS-LSTM has much better throughput than the CudnnLSTM
*** Synthetic task to show that linear LSTMs can still work well
*** Medical task
